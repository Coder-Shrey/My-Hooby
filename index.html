           Reading Books is my favorite hobby because each book is like its on life, a different story. Besides helping you acquire knowledge, reading keeps your brain active and engaged, helps reduce stress, and expands your vocabulary. In addition, a reading culture will help you develop stronger analytical skills as well as improve your ability to focus and concentrate. Overall, reading is a great way to develop and grow to a higher level.
